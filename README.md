# Alpha-NonZero

## Development plan

### Experimental (Python)
* Implement board representation and output similar to GLCWS [ ]
* Implement transformer architecture used in GLCWS [ ]
* Obtain chess games dataset (Lichess?) [ ]
* Implement Stockfish evaluation for chess positions to generate training data [ ]
* Set up training pipeline where we train the model on auto-generated training data and evaluate that it improves in strength [ ]

### Implement search mechanism (C++, CUDA, cuDNN)
* ... [ ]
